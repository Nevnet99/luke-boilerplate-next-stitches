    Atoms are used to build molecules and organisms. They are the smallest
    building blocks of matter. Applied to web interfaces, atoms are our HTML
    tags, such as a form label, an input or a button.
  </p>
  <p>
    Atoms can also include more abstract elements like color palettes, fonts and
    even more invisible aspects of an interface like animations.
  </p>
  <p>
    Atoms with the same properties can be grouped together as a molecule. For
    example, a form label, search input and button can be grouped together as a
    search form molecule.
  </p>
  <p>
    Similarly, groups of molecules can be joined together to form organisms. For
    example, a masthead, navbar, content area and footer can join together to
    form a website organism.
  </p>
  <p>
    Finally, organisms can be used to create templates. A template combines
    molecules and organisms to form a complete, distinct UI.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is the basic premise of Atomic Design. By starting with atoms and
    building up to organisms and templates, we create a design system that is
    scalable and maintainable.
